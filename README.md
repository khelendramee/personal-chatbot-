# personal-chatbot-You have created a chatbot using JavaScript that utilizes personal data for question-answering. The HTML page displays the frontend, with links to JavaScript and CSS files. The JavaScript code includes the logic for the chatbot, involving the creation of layers, nodes, and activation functions. Data is loaded from index.json, and predictions are made using weights for accuracy.

The chatbot processes input questions through word2vec, analyzes feature vectors, and predicts answers using a three-layer neural network. The CSS file styles the frontend, and the Python code loads data from main.txt into index.json after converting it to word2vec.

After running the program, you tested it with a question, and the chatbot generated an answer based on the appended data. However, when questioned about related data, the chatbot refused to provide an answer.
